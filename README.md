# Adult-Income-Prediction-Census-Data


This was a group project. Done with my teammate Sreelu.

•	Implemented ML Models like Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes from scratch and implemented Neural Networks with in-built libraries like Keras on the “Adult” dataset(extracted from 1994 census data) to predict and classify the data into two categories (income greater than 50k or not)
•	Based on the comparison, we have drawn a conclusion that for this particular dataset, the Logistic Regression model and Neural Networks model works best for our dataset.
